# isEvenGenerator
 Generates module that allows you to check if numbers are even or not in given range
This wonderful program is able to generate the Discrete Ultimate Majestic Beautiful Analyzer of Supreme Symbols **(D.U.M.B.A.S.S.)** that allows YOU to finally get the answer on the most intriguing question of all times - *"Is the number even or not?"*. D.U.M.B.A.S.S. not only solves this problem, but does this in the most efficient way possible (switch 'n case for every single number)! Code in this GitHub project was claimed as the most elegant thing ever written by authoritative programming experts:
- truly the code of all time (random guy from Discord)
- very useful (what_does_idk_mean#8924)
- please let me out of the basement (Dave)

Good luck!
